<h4>Look at Form tag attribute, which called "enctype" which takes a parameter value "multipart/form-data" 
    </br> this called multipart entity, later on we will discuss it with JSP directives at the first directive that will be the content type.

<form action="go" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
Select File:<input type="file" name="fname"/><br/>
<input type="image" src="MainUpload.png"/>
</form>
